### Online Retail Analytics 
## Customer Segmentation

Why: As every customer is unique and can be targeted in different ways. The Customer segmentation plays an important role in this case.

How: So we have created the customer segmentation as Low, Mid and High clusers based on the overall value of how recent the customer is, what is the frequency and how much revenue is earned from the particular customer.
This is calculated by using RFM model.

## Customer Lifetime Value

Why: In the current e-commerce world, almost every other retailer promotes its subscription and this is further used to understand the customer lifetime.  

How: In the project, we have used XGBClassifier model to predict the customer lifetime cluster which is categorized as LowCLV, MidCLV and HighCLV.

## Next Purchase Day
Why:Our objective is to analyze when our customer will purchase products in the future so for such customers we can build strategy and can come up with tactical solutions
How: For predicting next purchase day of our customers we developed KNN model and predicted our results in the form of classes where 
      class 0 represents Customers who Will Purchase in more than 50 days
      class 1 represents Customers who  Will Purchase in 21-49 days
      class 2 represents Customers who  Will Purchase in 0-20 days
