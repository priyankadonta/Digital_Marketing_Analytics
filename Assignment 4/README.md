Recommendation systems
You are working at Snackfair, a custom snack shipping company that only has an online presence.The company competed against many online subscription services (https://www.mysubscriptionaddiction.com/best-snack-subscription-boxes ) and wants to differentiate themselves with their superior recommendation system. The Data science team is interested in upgrading their recommendation system and have shortlisted 11 methods they could use. The have asked your team to put together a prototype of a recommendation system for one of the systems(See Appendix for team allocations). They have also reached out to 10 other teams and want to build a prototype using Streamlit to illustrate how to use it.

We were asked to work on FastAI Embedding Dot Bias(FAST).

### Deliverables
1. Since the company recognizes there are many approaches, the goal of this assignment is to replicate an experiment, understand when to use the algorithm using the default data given in https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders. For the allocated recommender, set up a working python environment and execute the algorithms.
2. In addition, we want to have a prototype that covers 0-3 stages of a typical recommendation workflow (https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/notebooks ). Create or modify notebooks to customize the four stages (0-3) for your recommender using the examples provided in https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/notebooks
3. You are also expected to propose a sample schema of the data needed for building a snack recommendation system. Create a sample dataset in csv format and illustrate how your recommender can be used for that dataset. You can be as creative as you want. You can also use python packages like Faker to create a dataset. Also check out Kaggleâ€™s datasets if you can use any of the existing datasets as a proxy
