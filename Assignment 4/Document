# Recommendation systems
    1. Collaboarative filtering
    2. Content based Filtering
    
FastAI Embedding Dot Bias(Collaboarative filtering):

  An embedding is a mapping from discrete objects, such as words or ids to a vector of continuous values. 
  This can be used to find similarities between the discrete objects that wouldn't be apparent to the model 
  if it didn't use embedding layers. These embedding vectors are low-dimensional and get updated whilst training the network.
  
 #Deliverables:
     There are 4 stages which we had to work on:
     1.Quick Start
     2.Data Preparation
     3.Fastai Model
     4.Evaluation
     We have selected "Snakdataset" in which we have million of rows and we have selected 100o rows for our evaluation and we 
     tried to know how is the model works and we should recommende this model.
     there are 3 columns here USerID,SnakID and Rating provided by the customers.
     
      Data Preparation consists of various splitting techniques such as Radom data split, Multi split, chronological split
      and stratifies split , we explored all these techniques in our data preparation.
      
      Fastai model:
      N_Factos and Epoch here N_factors is nothign but emebedded vector size and eopch is rating range for our data 
      it is from 1-5 so we have chosen 5 .
      
      Evaluation:
        Precision - this measures the proportion of recommended items that are relevant
        Recall - this measures the proportion of relevant items that are recommended
        Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) - evaluates how well the predicted items for a user are ranked based on relevance
        Mean Average Precision (MAP) - average precision for each user normalized over all users
